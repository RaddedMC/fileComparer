I wake up in the bed you made
The one where you're supposed to lay with me
I smell you on the pillowcase
But don't see your face, and that's okay with me
I never thought I'd see the day
I'd see you as somebody I could hate
I guess that's just the price I pay
For the blood-red flags that I walked past every day
Who are you when I'm not looking?
Despite those eyes that hooked me
When I'm not looking, you are someone else
Someone else
Someone
Who are you when I'm not looking?
I doubt you even know yourself
Despite those lies that took me
When I'm not looking, you are someone else
Hey
Is it me, did I fly you away?
Am I wrong?
Are you not who I say?
If I call, which one of you will answer anyway?
Who are you when I'm not looking?
Despite those eyes that hooked me
When I'm not looking, you are someone else
Who are you when I'm not looking?
I doubt you even know yourself
Despite those lies that took me
When I'm not looking, you are someone else
Someone
When I'm not looking, you are someone else
