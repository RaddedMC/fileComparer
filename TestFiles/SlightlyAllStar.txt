Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me
I ain't thdsgdfsg the shed
She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb
In the sdfgsdfgdfgdfgr forehead
Well the dsfgsdfgsdfgdgfdine if you don't glow
Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
Hey now, you'gdfsgdfsgdfsgdsstar, get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only fdsfs dsfhe mold
It's a cool place and they say it gets colder
You're bundled up now, wait till you get older
But the meteor men beg to differ
Judging by the hole in the satellite picture
The ice we skatdfsgdfsgdfsgdfsgdfsfttle fuel myself
And we could all use a little change
Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
So much tfdgssdfgdfsgdfsg star, get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the lold
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the bold
